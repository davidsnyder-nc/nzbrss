## SABnzbd Integration

This app can display your SABnzbd download queue and history in a dedicated tab. To enable this feature:

1. Open `index.html` in a text editor.
2. Locate the configuration section at the top of the file:
   - Set `SABNZBD_URL` to the base URL of your SABnzbd server (e.g., `http://192.168.1.20:8080`).
   - Set `SABNZBD_API_KEY` to your SABnzbd API key (found in SABnzbd under Config > General > API Key).
3. Save the file and open it in your browser.

**Note:**
- For SABnzbd integration to work, your browser must be able to access the SABnzbd server directly (usually on the same local network).
- If you encounter CORS errors, you may need to use a browser extension or proxy to allow cross-origin requests.
- The Downloads tab will show your current queue and recent history, including status and progress bars.
